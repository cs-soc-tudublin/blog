# CS++ Blog

This repository contains all of the blog posts from CS++. They are served [here](https://cspp.ie/).
The Blog system is based closely off Redbrick's [blog](https://github.com/redbrick/blog).

Blog Posts are usually written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which provides an easy experience to write Markdown files!
This repository contains the .obisidan file, which installs the relevant theme and plugins for writing blog posts easily.

# How to Write a Blog Post
1. Copy another blog post to get the template
2. Edit the author, tags, and title
